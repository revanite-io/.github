# Security Policy for Revanite

Version: **v0.1 (2023-08-14)**

## Preface

Revanite currently only supports non-production use cases. But in spite of that, the Revanite Project team places high value on security considerations, and is continuously working on improving it.

## Supported Versions

We do not extend assurances or updates for any versions prior to the latest minor version. We will add security updates as semver "patch" releases only for the highest minor version.

For example, updates will be added to `v1.3` only until `v1.4` is released. If a security update was added in `v1.3.1`, then `v1.4.0` is released, any defects found will be fixed in `v1.4.1` and there will not be a `v1.3.2`.

In the event that a new major version is released, we will revisit this documentation to update accordingly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security related bug in Revanite, we kindly ask you for
responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze and
develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability.

We will do our best to react quickly on your inquiry, and to coordinate a fix
and disclosure with you. Sometimes, it might take a little longer for us to
react (e.g. out of office conditions), so please bear with us in these cases.

We will publish security advisories using the
GitHub Security Advisories feature for each repository: <https://github.com/revanite-io/[repository_name]/security/advisories> (i.e., <https://github.com/revanite-io/sci/security/advisories>).
feature to keep our community well-informed, and will credit you for your
findings (unless you prefer to stay anonymous, of course).
